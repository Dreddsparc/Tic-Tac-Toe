# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple tic-tac-toe in Python.  Starting as text console game, then eventually using kivy, make it work on android 
and hopefully allow for multi-player functionality between friends, as well as a single player mode that will allow
for a choice of different levels of AI to play against.

Leaderboards are are a possibility to show ranks between both human and ai opponents.
